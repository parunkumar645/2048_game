Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have a modern web browser installed.

Project Folder Structure
To keep the project organized, we follow a simple folder structure:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
style.css: Includes the CSS styles for the game layout and appearance.
script.js: Contains the JavaScript code for implementing the game logic and handling user interactions.
Building the Game
HTML
Create the game board using HTML, consisting of a grid with multiple boxes representing the tiles. Include elements for the start button, score display, and the game over screen. Proper comments have been added to enhance understanding.

CSS
Style the game using CSS, defining the grid layout, box styles, animations, and transitions to make the game visually appealing. Design the game-over screen and the start button. Use CSS classes for applying styles to different elements to maintain code organization.

JavaScript
Implement the game logic using JavaScript. Handle user interactions, including swiping and keyboard controls. The code generates random tiles, updates the game matrix, and checks for game-over conditions. Keep track of the score and update it accordingly. Detailed comments are provided to explain the functionality of the code.
